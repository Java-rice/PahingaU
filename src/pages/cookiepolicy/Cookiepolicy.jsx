          Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer,
          tablet, or mobile) when you visit a website. They are widely used to
          make websites work more efficiently and to provide information to the
          owners of the site. Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies.

        <p className="font-poppins font-medium text-[#1A1A1A] text-base sm:text-xl mb-8">
          We use the following types of cookies on our website:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
            <li>
              Essential Cookies are necessary for the website to function
              properly. They enable you to navigate our site and use its
              features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies,
              certain services you have requested cannot be provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance Cookies collect information about how visitors use our
              website, such as which pages are visited most often and if they
              receive error messages from web pages. These cookies do not
              collect information that identifies a visitor. All information
              these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is
              only used to improve how our website works.
            </li>
            <li>
              Functionality Cookies allow our website to remember choices you
              make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in)
              and provide enhanced, more personalized features. For instance,
              they can be used to remember changes you have made to text size,
              fonts, and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They
              may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as
              watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these
              cookies collect may be anonymized, and they cannot track your
              browsing activity on other websites.
            </li>
            <li>
              Targeting Cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you
              and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of
              times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness
              of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by
              advertising networks with the website operatorâ€™s permission. They
              remember that you have visited a website, and this information is
              shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Often,
              targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site
              functionality provided by the other organization.
